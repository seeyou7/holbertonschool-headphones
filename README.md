# Implement a Design from Scratch 💻

## Description 💬
In this project, "Implement a Design from Scratch," the goal is to create a web page entirely from the ground up using only raw HTML and CSS, without relying on any external libraries. This exercise emphasizes applying your knowledge in HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design, with a focus on creative freedom and minimal instruction. The primary objective is to develop a fully functional, responsive web page that perfectly aligns with the provided designer file. It challenges your ability to translate a design concept into a live, user-friendly, and accessible web page, ensuring it matches the original design specifications across various devices and screen sizes.

## Tasks 📚

### 0. Read and be familiar with Figma
Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

### 1. Header
Building a web page the right way is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:
- Reset CSS styling
- Use variables
- Simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- Avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
- Simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

### 2. "What we do..." section
Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section.

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here is the archive of it: `holberton_school-icon.zip`. Inside, you will find a demo page of how to use it.

### 3. "Our results" section
Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the “Our results” section.

Now you can reuse components from the previous task!

### 4. Contact us
Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page always has a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

### 5. Footer
Copy files from the previous task.

The last piece of the page… the Footer!
